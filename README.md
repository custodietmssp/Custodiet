For you New Users!
=======

Welcome to Custodiet!

Custodiet is the world's first Open Source MSSP Framework.  
It's not a Managed Security Services Provider.  
It's how YOU become a Managed Security Services Provider.

We use various open source projects, some scripting, and sprinkle some magic code into the mix.  
It accomplishes a few things.

<b>For your customers:</b>

Remote Access -  for Snow days or travelers<br>
Security Concerns - Who tells me what’s important? <br>
Compliance - HIPAA, ISO, PCI, etc.( If it’s not logged it’s not done)<br>
Secure Remote Tech- enable/disable remote support<br>
Have I been hacked? - Log analysis and FIM<br>

<b>For you:</b>

Set up your own MSSP (Turn key) <br>
Build it for your office, your house, or the clients you find and profit from.<br>
Contribute back to the Community (scripts, features, etc)  Get Prizes/Bounties!<br>
Build your own business. Side or primary, your choice. <br>
<i>Be in charge of your destiny!</i><br>
